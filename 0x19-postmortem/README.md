## Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

### Issue Summary

* Duration: May 1, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 2, 2023, 12:00 PM (GMT)

* Impact: The messaging service was completely unavailable during the outage, affecting 75% of our active users. Users were unable to send or receive messages, causing significant disruption to their communication activities.

* Root Cause: The cause of the web stack outage was identified as a database connection leak, resulting in resource exhaustion and subsequent service unavailability. Due to the high load and increased traffic on the platform, the system failed to manage and release database connections efficiently, leading to the depletion of available connections and subsequent failure of the messaging service.

### Timeline

* May 1, 2023, 10:00 AM (GMT): The issue was first detected when an engineer noticed a spike in error logs related to database connection failures.

* May 1, 2023, 10:15 AM (GMT): The monitoring system triggered an alert indicating a significant increase in error rates and service degradation.

* Actions Taken:
    * The engineering team immediately investigated the issue, focusing on the database and network infrastructure.
    * Initially, it was assumed that the high load on the messaging service might be causing the database connection failures.
    * The team scaled up the database cluster and increased connection pool sizes to alleviate the issue.

* Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
    * Initial investigation focused on network congestion and potential DDoS attacks, leading to unnecessary time spent on network infrastructure analysis.
    * The team also explored code-level issues and potential bugs in the messaging service, but these investigations did not reveal the root cause.

* Escalation:
    * As the issue persisted and the impact increased, the incident was escalated to the senior engineering team and the operations manager.
    * Database administrators were also engaged to provide additional expertise.

* Incident Resolution:
    * After identifying the database connection leak as the root cause, the team implemented a temporary workaround by restarting the messaging service periodically to release accumulated connections.
    * To ensure a permanent fix, the team optimized the connection pooling mechanism, improved connection handling, and introduced better resource management practices.
    * The issue was ultimately resolved on May 2, 2023, at 4:00 PM (GMT) when the messaging service was fully restored.

### Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause was a database connection leak, resulting in the exhaustion of available connections. This leak occurred due to inefficient connection management in the messaging service. To fix the issue, the team optimized the connection pooling mechanism to handle connections more effectively. They also implemented stricter resource management practices, ensuring proper release and reuse of connections. This solution resolved the immediate problem and prevented future incidents of connection exhaustion.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

* To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
    * Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for database connection usage and failures.
    * Conduct regular load testing to identify and address potential resource leaks or bottlenecks.
    * Perform code reviews and incorporate connection management best practices into the development process.
    * Enhance documentation and knowledge sharing within the team regarding common web stack issues and their resolutions.
    * Schedule periodic infrastructure audits to ensure optimal performance and scalability.
    * Implement automated scaling mechanisms to handle increased traffic and load gracefully.

* Tasks to Address the Issue:
    * Implement enhanced connection pooling mechanisms and resource management practices within the messaging service codebase.
    * Conduct a thorough review of the database configuration and optimize connection pool settings.
    * Develop and deploy additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms for database connection usage and failures.
    * Provide training sessions for engineers on efficient connection management and resource optimization.
    * Update incident response protocols to include early engagement of database administrators
